Finding sequences of pulses which map (for example)
    (|0> + a|1> + b|2>)|g>  ->  |x>|e>,
    (|0> - a|1>)|g>         ->  |y>|g>, and
    (a|1> - b|2>)|g>        ->  |z>|g>
simultaneously, so that we can project a target state (the first one) into only
|e> states, and an orthogonal basis set purely onto the |g>.  Detection in the
ion trap is essentially the projection \<x|e>\<e|x>, so to measure three-slit
interference effects we're much better doing that than anything else.
